# AMQP 0-9-1 Spec Archive

This repository contains a number of AMQP 0-9-1-related pages
that historically were a part of the RabbitMQ website.

## What's in This Repository

## PDFs

AMQP 0-9-1 spec documents can be found under `./pdfs`. This is one of the most important parts for those looking
to contribute to an AMQP 0-9-1 client or RabbitMQ.

## RabbitMQ Protocol Reference Pages and Errata

Protocol reference, implementation status and errata pages
that cover Team RabbitMQ's implementation of AMQP 0-8-9 and AMQP 0-9-1,
RabbitMQ's original core protocols, can be found as Markdown files
under `./docs`.

## XML

Machine-readable files mean to be used for AMQP 0-9-1 parser generation
can be found under `./xmls`. See [`rabbitmq-codgen`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/main/deps/rabbitmq_codegen)
to understand how they are supposed to be used.
